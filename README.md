## Project Web Scrapping

*Welcome to my project !*

This project aims to make it more easy for travelers to understand their carbon impact when choosing a flight.

I wanted to help users to make more responsible choices.

Here are a summary of what I used to accomplish the tasks :
- Streamlit for the API part
- BeautifulSoup and Selenium for the Scraping part
- Sklearn with Linear Regression for the ML part.

I scraped data from Google Flight and I was planning to use ICAO as second scraping site where I could get the mean of the carbon emission from one place to another.

But unfortunatly the site was down for a long period so I gave up on it for the Machine Learning part and did some Linear Regression based on the maximum carbon emission of all flights (splitting in 3 categories the flights : Low carbon impact, Medium and Heavy).

If needed you can consult the Word "Part1" to have the context of the project. 

You have also the presentation I did on Friday 24th, all the code (API, scraping and ML).

I hope you'll find this project interesting. It's very simple but I hope you'll enjoy it ! :)
